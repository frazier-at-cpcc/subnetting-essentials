Now that you have an understanding of the IP address classes, let’s move on to the concept of **Private Address Spaces**.

### Private Address Spaces
#### **Overview**

Private IP address spaces are reserved for use within private networks and are not routable on the global internet. These addresses allow organizations to create internal networks without consuming public IP address space. Devices on these private networks communicate using local addressing but require Network Address Translation (NAT) to communicate with external networks.

#### **Private Address Ranges**

The private IP address spaces are divided into three major ranges based on IP class:

- **Class A Private Range:** `10.0.0.0/8`
  - **Range:** 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - **Hosts per Network:** 16,777,216
  - **Use Case:** Suitable for very large private networks, such as those used by large organizations or data centers.

- **Class B Private Range:** `172.16.0.0/12`
  - **Range:** 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - **Hosts per Network:** 1,048,576
  - **Use Case:** Used for medium to large-sized private networks, often found in organizations with multiple departments or locations.

- **Class C Private Range:** `192.168.0.0/16`
  - **Range:** 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
  - **Hosts per Network:** 65,536
  - **Use Case:** Commonly used for small office or home networks (SOHO).

#### **Purpose of Private IP Addresses**

Private address spaces are used to:
- Conserve globally unique IPv4 addresses by allowing reuse within private networks.
- Enable internal communication within an organization without exposing internal devices to the public internet.
- Allow multiple devices in private networks to share a single public IP address through Network Address Translation (NAT).

#### **Private vs Public IP Addressing**

- **Private IP Addresses:** 
  - Are not routable on the public internet.
  - Must be unique within the local network but can be reused across different private networks.

- **Public IP Addresses:** 
  - Are globally unique and routable on the public internet.
  - Assigned by an internet service provider (ISP) or a regional internet registry (RIR).

#### **Example Scenarios**

1. **Corporate Network:**
   A large enterprise uses the `10.0.0.0/8` private range for its internal departments, with each department allocated a different subnet (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16 for HR, 10.2.0.0/16 for IT).

2. **Home Network:**
   A home network uses the `192.168.0.0/24` range to assign private addresses to devices such as computers, smartphones, and smart home devices.

#### **Summary**

Private IP addresses are essential for managing internal communication in networks and reducing the demand for public IP addresses. These addresses are widely used in corporate networks, homes, and small businesses, providing flexibility and security by keeping internal traffic within the local network.

| Class | Private Range               | Hosts per Network   | Use Case                 |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| A     | 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255   | 16,777,216          | Large private networks   |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 | 1,048,576           | Medium-sized networks    |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 | 65,536            | Small office/home networks|

Next, we will explore **Special Address Ranges** that are reserved for specific purposes in networking.

### Special Address Ranges
#### **Overview**

In addition to private IP address spaces, there are several special address ranges that serve specific purposes in networking. These ranges are reserved for use in testing, multicasting, and device communication within a local network. Understanding these ranges is crucial for network administrators to ensure proper network configurations and operations.

#### **Loopback Address Range**

- **Range:** `127.0.0.0/8` (typically `127.0.0.1` is used)
- **Purpose:** The loopback address is used for testing and diagnostics within a local machine. It allows a device to send network traffic to itself, which is useful for testing network software.
- **Example Use Case:** Testing a web server running on the same machine using `127.0.0.1`.

#### **Link-Local Address Range**

- **Range:** `169.254.0.0/16`
- **Purpose:** Link-local addresses are automatically assigned when a device cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. These addresses are used for communication within the local network but are not routable on the wider internet.
- **Example Use Case:** When a device connects to a network without a DHCP server, it assigns itself a link-local address, allowing it to communicate with other devices on the same network.

#### **Multicast Address Range**

- **Range:** `224.0.0.0/4`
- **Purpose:** Multicast addresses are used for the simultaneous transmission of data to multiple recipients. This is useful for services such as streaming media or video conferencing.
- **Example Use Case:** Sending a video stream to multiple devices on a network using a multicast address like `224.0.1.1`.

#### **Anycast Address Range**

- **Range:** Reserved IPs within `233.0.0.0/8`
- **Purpose:** Anycast is used to route data to the nearest or best destination in a group of potential receivers that share the same address. It helps improve performance and reliability by routing traffic to the closest server.
- **Example Use Case:** Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) use anycast to direct users to the nearest server for faster loading times.

#### **Broadcast Address**

- **Range:** Varies depending on the subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.255` for a `/24` subnet)
- **Purpose:** Broadcast addresses allow data to be sent to all devices on a specific network. Broadcast traffic is used for network discovery and communication.
- **Example Use Case:** ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests are sent to the broadcast address to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.

#### **Summary**

Special address ranges play a critical role in various networking functions, from device diagnostics and testing to efficient data distribution through multicast and anycast routing. Understanding these addresses ensures that networks are configured properly for both internal and external communication.

| Special Address Range      | Purpose                     | Example Use Case                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 127.0.0.0/8 (Loopback)      | Internal testing and diagnostics | Testing software on local machine      |
| 169.254.0.0/16 (Link-local) | Communication without DHCP   | Devices communicating in absence of DHCP |
| 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast)     | Sending data to multiple devices | Streaming video to multiple devices    |
| 233.0.0.0/8 (Anycast)       | Routing to nearest receiver  | CDN directing traffic to nearest server |
| Network-specific Broadcast  | Sending data to all devices  | ARP requests or network discovery      |

Next, we will explore **Default Subnet Masks** and how they are used to segment networks.

### Default Subnet Masks
#### **Overview**

A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that segments an IP address into the network and host portions. The subnet mask helps determine which part of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the host (a device or interface). Each class of IP address (A, B, C) has a default subnet mask that defines how much of the address is used for the network and how much for the hosts.

#### **Default Subnet Masks by IP Class**

| IP Class | Address Range               | Default Subnet Mask | Network Bits | Host Bits   | Maximum Hosts per Network |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| A        | 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255    | 255.0.0.0           | 8            | 24          | 16,777,214                 |
| B        | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255  | 255.255.0.0         | 16           | 16          | 65,534                     |
| C        | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255  | 255.255.255.0       | 24           | 8           | 254                        |

#### **Class A Subnet Mask (255.0.0.0)**

- **Network Portion:** The first 8 bits (1st octet) identify the network.
- **Host Portion:** The remaining 24 bits (3 octets) identify hosts.
- **Use Case:** Class A networks are suitable for very large networks with millions of hosts, such as ISPs and large corporations.

#### **Class B Subnet Mask (255.255.0.0)**

- **Network Portion:** The first 16 bits (2 octets) identify the network.
- **Host Portion:** The remaining 16 bits (2 octets) identify hosts.
- **Use Case:** Class B networks are used for medium-sized networks like large organizations or universities.

#### **Class C Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0)**

- **Network Portion:** The first 24 bits (3 octets) identify the network.
- **Host Portion:** The remaining 8 bits (1 octet) identify hosts.
- **Use Case:** Class C networks are ideal for small networks, like small businesses or home networks.

#### **Why Are Subnet Masks Important?**

- **Network Segmentation:** Subnet masks are used to divide a network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.
- **Routing:** Routers use subnet masks to determine whether traffic is for a local network or if it needs to be routed to another network.
- **Network Efficiency:** By limiting the number of hosts in a network, subnet masks help minimize network traffic and reduce the chances of network collisions.

#### **CIDR Notation**

Subnet masks can also be expressed using **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation. In CIDR, the subnet mask is represented by a slash (/) followed by the number of network bits.

- **Examples:**
  - Class A: `/8` (255.0.0.0)
  - Class B: `/16` (255.255.0.0)
  - Class C: `/24` (255.255.255.0)

#### **Example: Using Subnet Masks in Practice**

Suppose you have an IP address `192.168.1.10` with a default Class C subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`. To determine which part of the address represents the network and which part represents the host:

- **Network Portion:** The first three octets (`192.168.1`) represent the network.
- **Host Portion:** The last octet (`.10`) represents the host.

Thus, the network address for `192.168.1.10` would be `192.168.1.0`, and the broadcast address would be `192.168.1.255`.

#### **Conclusion**

Default subnet masks play a crucial role in determining the size and structure of networks. Understanding how subnet masks divide IP addresses into network and host portions helps in the design and implementation of efficient and scalable networks.

### Binary to Decimal Conversion
#### **Overview**

IP addresses are represented as a series of 32 binary digits (1s and 0s), but humans often use decimal notation for readability. Converting binary to decimal is an essential skill for understanding how devices communicate on a network. This section will guide you through the process of converting binary IP addresses into decimal format.

#### **Steps for Binary to Decimal Conversion**

To convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent, you can follow these steps:

1. **Write down the binary number**: Start with the binary IP address, which is usually divided into four octets.
   
2. **Assign powers of 2 to each bit**: Starting from the rightmost bit (least significant), assign the value of 2 raised to the power of its position in the binary sequence (from right to left, starting with 0).

3. **Multiply each bit by its corresponding power of 2**: Only the bits that are set to 1 contribute to the final decimal value.

4. **Add the results**: Sum the values from each octet to get the final decimal number for each.

Next, let’s move on to **Decimal to Binary Conversion** to learn how to reverse the process and convert decimal IP addresses back to binary.

### Decimal to Binary Conversion
#### **Overview**

Just as binary can be converted to decimal, it’s also important to know how to convert decimal numbers back into binary. This is especially useful in networking when determining network and host portions of an IP address. In this section, we will walk through the steps to convert a decimal IP address into binary format.

#### **Steps for Decimal to Binary Conversion**

To convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent, follow these steps:

1. **Write down the decimal number**: Start with the decimal IP address, which consists of four octets (numbers between 0 and 255).

2. **Divide the decimal number by 2**: For each octet, continuously divide the number by 2, noting the remainder each time.

3. **Record the remainders**: The remainder from each division step forms a binary digit (1 or 0).

4. **Reverse the order of the remainders**: The remainders form the binary equivalent, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost).

  - 63 ÷ 2 = 31, remainder = 1
  - 31 ÷ 2 = 15, remainder = 1
  - 15 ÷ 2 = 7, remainder = 1
  - 7 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder = 1
  - 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder = 1
  - 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder = 1
  - **Binary for 255** = `11111111`

- **Final Binary IP Address**: `00001010.00000000.00001111.11111111`

#### **Conclusion**

Converting decimal to binary is an essential skill when working with IP addresses in networking. Understanding how to perform this conversion allows you to manipulate and analyze IP addresses for tasks like subnetting and IP planning.

In the next section, we will explore **ANDing with Subnet Masks** and learn how to identify the network portion of an IP address.
### ANDing with Default Subnet Masks
#### **Overview**

ANDing is a bitwise operation used in networking to identify the network portion of an IP address. This operation involves comparing an IP address with its corresponding subnet mask to determine which part of the address belongs to the network and which part is reserved for hosts. Understanding how to AND with default subnet masks is crucial for tasks like subnetting and routing.

#### **What is ANDing?**

ANDing is a binary operation where two bits are compared:
- 1 AND 1 = 1
- 1 AND 0 = 0
- 0 AND 0 = 0

When we AND an IP address with a subnet mask, we compare each bit in the IP address with the corresponding bit in the subnet mask. This operation identifies the network portion (the part of the IP address that corresponds to the 1s in the subnet mask).

#### **Steps for ANDing with Default Subnet Masks**

1. **Convert the IP address and subnet mask to binary**: Write down the binary equivalent of both the IP address and the default subnet mask.

2. **Perform the AND operation**: Compare each bit of the IP address with the corresponding bit in the subnet mask. Apply the AND rule to determine the result.

3. **Result**: The result of the AND operation gives you the network portion of the IP address.

#### **Example: ANDing with a Default Subnet Mask**

Let’s say you have the following IP address and a default Class C subnet mask:

- **IP Address**: `192.168.1.10`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`

1. **Convert to Binary**:

   - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.10`
     - `11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010`

   - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`
     - `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`

2. **AND the IP Address and Subnet Mask**:

   - IP: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010`
   - Mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`
   - Result: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000`

3. **Convert the Result to Decimal**:
   - **Network Address**: `192.168.1.0`

This shows that the network portion of the IP address `192.168.1.10` is `192.168.1.0`.

#### **Practice Problem**

Try ANDing the following IP address with the default Class B subnet mask:

- **IP Address**: `172.16.45.78`
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0`

- What is the network address?

```ascii
[ANDing Practice]
Please enter the network address for the IP address above:
```

#### **Solution to Practice Problem**

1. **Convert to Binary**:
   - **IP Address**: `172.16.45.78`
     - `10101100.00010000.00101101.01001110`
   - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0`
     - `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`

2. **AND the IP Address and Subnet Mask**:
   - IP: `10101100.00010000.00101101.01001110`
   - Mask: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`
   - Result: `10101100.00010000.00000000.00000000`

3. **Convert the Result to Decimal**:
   - **Network Address**: `172.16.0.0`

#### **Why ANDing with Subnet Masks is Important**

ANDing is crucial because it allows you to:
- Identify the network portion of an IP address.
- Ensure proper routing by determining whether an IP belongs to the same network or a different one.
- Simplify the process of subnetting by clearly defining network boundaries.

#### **Conclusion**

Understanding ANDing with default subnet masks is fundamental for working with IP networks. It helps network administrators quickly determine the network segment an IP address belongs to, making tasks like subnetting, routing, and IP planning easier.

---

In the next section, we will explore **ANDing with Custom Subnet Masks**, where we apply the same principle to custom subnet sizes.


### ANDing with Custom Subnet Masks
#### **Overview**

While ANDing with default subnet masks helps identify the network portion for standard networks (Class A, B, or C), many networks use custom subnet masks to divide the network into smaller subnets. Custom subnet masks are used when networks require more flexibility in the number of hosts or subnets. This section will guide you through how to perform the AND operation using custom subnet masks.

#### **What is a Custom Subnet Mask?**

A custom subnet mask extends the number of network bits beyond the default mask, allowing you to create subnets of different sizes. For example, instead of using the default Class C mask `/24` (255.255.255.0), you could use `/26` (255.255.255.192) to create more subnets with fewer hosts in each.

#### **Steps for ANDing with Custom Subnet Masks**

1. **Convert the IP address and custom subnet mask to binary**: Write down the binary equivalents of both the IP address and the custom subnet mask.

2. **Perform the AND operation**: Compare each bit of the IP address with the corresponding bit in the subnet mask, using the AND rule (1 AND 1 = 1, otherwise 0).

3. **Result**: The result of the AND operation gives you the network address for that particular subnet.

#### **Example: ANDing with a Custom Subnet Mask**

Let’s take an IP address and a custom subnet mask:

- **IP Address**: `192.168.1.130`
- **Custom Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.192` (This is a `/26` subnet mask, which allows for 64 IP addresses per subnet)

1. **Convert to Binary**:

   - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.130`
     - `11000000.10101000.00000001.10000010`
   
   - **Custom Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.192`
     - `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000`

2. **AND the IP Address and Subnet Mask**:

   - IP: `11000000.10101000.00000001.10000010`
   - Mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000`
   - Result: `11000000.10101000.00000001.10000000`

3. **Convert the Result to Decimal**:
   - **Network Address**: `192.168.1.128`

This shows that the IP address `192.168.1.130` belongs to the subnet `192.168.1.128/26`.

#### **Practice Problem**

Let’s practice ANDing with a custom subnet mask. Perform the AND operation for the following IP address and custom subnet mask:

- **IP Address**: `10.10.5.200`
- **Custom Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.224` (This is a `/27` subnet mask)

- What is the network address?

```ascii
[ANDing Practice]
Please enter the network address for the IP address above:
```

#### **Solution to Practice Problem**

1. **Convert to Binary**:
   - **IP Address**: `10.10.5.200`
     - `00001010.00001010.00000101.11001000`
   
   - **Custom Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.224`
     - `11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000`

2. **AND the IP Address and Subnet Mask**:
   - IP: `00001010.00001010.00000101.11001000`
   - Mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000`
   - Result: `00001010.00001010.00000101.11000000`

3. **Convert the Result to Decimal**:
   - **Network Address**: `10.10.5.192`

#### **Why Use Custom Subnet Masks?**

Custom subnet masks offer more flexibility in network design by allowing you to:
- Create multiple subnets of different sizes from a larger network block.
- Optimize the use of IP address space by reducing wasted addresses.
- Segment traffic for better security and management.

#### **Conclusion**

ANDing with custom subnet masks is essential for modern network design, where creating subnets of varying sizes is often required. By mastering this skill, you can design efficient networks that make better use of available IP address space.

---

Next, let’s move on to **Subnetting Calculations**, where you'll learn how to determine the size and structure of different subnets.

### Activity
## Subnetting Calculations
### Subnetting Calculations

#### **Overview**

Subnetting involves dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnets. Each subnet operates as an independent network, allowing you to efficiently use IP address space, improve security, and optimize network performance. In this section, we will focus on the calculations needed to determine the appropriate subnet mask, calculate the number of subnets and hosts, and identify key network elements such as network and broadcast addresses.

#### **Steps for Subnetting Calculations**

To perform subnetting calculations, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Subnet Mask**:
   - Start by deciding how many subnets or hosts you need. The subnet mask will define how many bits are used for the network versus the hosts.

2. **Calculate the Number of Subnets**:
   - Use the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Number of Subnets} = 2^n
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion of the address.

3. **Calculate the Number of Hosts per Subnet**:
   - Use the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Number of Hosts} = 2^h - 2
     \]
     where \( h \) is the number of host bits, and the subtraction of 2 accounts for the network and broadcast addresses.

4. **Identify the Network and Broadcast Addresses**:
   - The network address is the first address in each subnet, and the broadcast address is the last. The range between these addresses represents usable host addresses.

#### **Example: Subnetting a Class C Network**

Let’s take the network `192.168.10.0/24` and subnet it into 4 subnets.

1. **Determine the Subnet Mask**:
   - To create 4 subnets, we need to borrow 2 bits from the host portion (because \( 2^2 = 4 \)).
   - The default Class C subnet mask is `255.255.255.0` (`/24`). Borrowing 2 bits gives us a new subnet mask of `255.255.255.192` (`/26`).

2. **Calculate the Number of Hosts per Subnet**:
   - With 6 bits remaining for hosts (8 bits in the original Class C - 2 bits borrowed for subnetting), we can calculate the number of hosts per subnet:
     \[
     2^6 - 2 = 62 \text{ hosts per subnet}
     \]

3. **Identify the Network and Broadcast Addresses**:

   - **Subnet 1**:  
     - Network Address: `192.168.10.0`
     - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.63`
     - Usable IP Range: `192.168.10.1` – `192.168.10.62`
     
   - **Subnet 2**:  
     - Network Address: `192.168.10.64`
     - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.127`
     - Usable IP Range: `192.168.10.65` – `192.168.10.126`
     
   - **Subnet 3**:  
     - Network Address: `192.168.10.128`
     - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.191`
     - Usable IP Range: `192.168.10.129` – `192.168.10.190`
     
   - **Subnet 4**:  
     - Network Address: `192.168.10.192`
     - Broadcast Address: `192.168.10.255`
     - Usable IP Range: `192.168.10.193` – `192.168.10.254`

#### **Practice Problem**

You are given the network `172.16.0.0/16` and need to create 8 subnets. Calculate the subnet mask, the number of hosts per subnet, and the network and broadcast addresses for the first two subnets.

```ascii
[Subnetting Calculator]
Please enter the subnet mask, the number of hosts per subnet, and the network/broadcast addresses for the first two subnets:
```

#### **Solution to Practice Problem**

1. **Determine the Subnet Mask**:
   - Borrow 3 bits from the host portion of the Class B address (`2^3 = 8 subnets`).
   - The new subnet mask is `255.255.224.0` (`/19`).

2. **Calculate the Number of Hosts per Subnet**:
   - With 13 host bits remaining, the number of hosts per subnet is:
     \[
     2^{13} - 2 = 8,190 \text{ hosts per subnet}
     \]

3. **Identify the Network and Broadcast Addresses for the First Two Subnets**:
   - **Subnet 1**:  
     - Network Address: `172.16.0.0`
     - Broadcast Address: `172.16.31.255`
     - Usable IP Range: `172.16.0.1` – `172.16.31.254`
   
   - **Subnet 2**:  
     - Network Address: `172.16.32.0`
     - Broadcast Address: `172.16.63.255`
     - Usable IP Range: `172.16.32.1` – `172.16.63.254`

#### **Why Subnetting Calculations Matter**

Subnetting calculations allow network administrators to:
- Efficiently allocate IP addresses.
- Design networks that can scale easily.
- Reduce broadcast traffic and improve performance.

#### **Conclusion**

Subnetting calculations are essential for creating subnets that meet the needs of a network, whether it’s for a small office or a large enterprise. By mastering subnetting calculations, you can design networks that optimize IP address usage, improve performance, and scale with future growth.

---

Next, let’s explore **Calculating Custom Subnet Masks**, where you'll learn to create subnet masks tailored to specific network requirements.

### Calculating Custom Subnet Masks
#### **Overview**

Custom subnet masks allow you to create subnetworks with specific numbers of hosts and subnets, tailored to your network's needs. Calculating a custom subnet mask involves determining how many bits should be borrowed from the host portion to create the desired number of subnets. This flexibility allows network administrators to efficiently use IP address space and control network segmentation.

#### **Steps for Calculating a Custom Subnet Mask**

1. **Determine the Required Subnets or Hosts**:
   - Decide whether the goal is to create a specific number of subnets or to support a particular number of hosts within each subnet.

2. **Calculate the Number of Bits to Borrow**:
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     2^n \geq \text{Required Subnets}
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion.

3. **Calculate the New Subnet Mask**:
   - Add the borrowed bits to the default subnet mask for your IP class to determine the custom subnet mask.

4. **Verify the Number of Hosts per Subnet**:
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     2^h - 2 \geq \text{Required Hosts}
     \]
     where \( h \) is the remaining number of host bits.

#### **Example: Creating a Custom Subnet Mask**

Let’s say you have the network `192.168.1.0/24` and you need to create 8 subnets. Here’s how you can calculate the custom subnet mask:

1. **Determine the Number of Bits to Borrow**:
   - You need at least 8 subnets. To calculate the number of bits required, use the formula:
     \[
     2^n \geq 8 \quad \text{so} \quad n = 3
     \]
     - Borrow 3 bits from the host portion.

2. **Calculate the New Subnet Mask**:
   - The default subnet mask for a Class C network is `255.255.255.0` (`/24`).
   - Adding 3 borrowed bits changes the subnet mask to `255.255.255.224` (`/27`).

3. **Verify the Number of Hosts per Subnet**:
   - With 5 remaining host bits (`32 total bits - 27 network bits = 5 host bits`):
     \[
     2^5 - 2 = 30 \text{ hosts per subnet}
     \]
   - This gives you 30 usable hosts per subnet.

#### **Example Result**:
You’ve created 8 subnets, each with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.224` and 30 usable hosts.

#### **Practice Problem**

You are given the network `10.0.0.0/8` and need to create 16 subnets. What is the custom subnet mask, and how many hosts can each subnet support?

```ascii
[Subnet Mask Calculator]
Please enter the custom subnet mask and the number of hosts per subnet for the IP address range:
```

#### **Solution to Practice Problem**

1. **Determine the Number of Bits to Borrow**:
   - You need at least 16 subnets. Using the formula:
     \[
     2^n \geq 16 \quad \text{so} \quad n = 4
     \]
     - Borrow 4 bits from the host portion.

2. **Calculate the New Subnet Mask**:
   - The default subnet mask for a Class A network is `255.0.0.0` (`/8`).
   - Adding 4 borrowed bits changes the subnet mask to `255.240.0.0` (`/12`).

3. **Verify the Number of Hosts per Subnet**:
   - With 20 remaining host bits (`32 total bits - 12 network bits = 20 host bits`):
     \[
     2^{20} - 2 = 1,048,574 \text{ hosts per subnet}
     \]

#### **Why Calculate Custom Subnet Masks?**

Custom subnet masks provide flexibility in network design:
- **Efficient Use of IP Space**: By tailoring the subnet mask to the specific number of subnets and hosts needed, you avoid wasting IP addresses.
- **Network Segmentation**: Custom subnetting allows for better traffic isolation and security by separating different departments or services.
- **Scalability**: Custom subnet masks can accommodate network growth without the need to redesign the entire addressing scheme.

#### **Conclusion**

Calculating custom subnet masks allows you to optimize network performance and scalability while effectively managing IP address space. This essential skill is key to designing networks that meet the unique needs of any organization.

### Addressing Scheme Design

The Challenge
-------------
Sarah, the lead network engineer at NetworkCo, a growing tech company, faced a daunting task. The company was expanding rapidly, opening new offices across the country, and their current IP addressing scheme was becoming a tangled mess. With each new office, the ad-hoc approach to assigning IP addresses was causing conflicts, making network management a nightmare, and hindering further growth.

As Sarah stared at the network diagram plastered across her office wall, she knew it was time for a change. "We need a comprehensive IP addressing scheme that can accommodate our current needs and future growth," she muttered to herself. "But where do I start?"

The Journey Begins
------------------
Sarah decided to approach this challenge methodically. She gathered her team and began to outline the key considerations they needed to address:

1. **Current Network Size**: They had to account for all existing devices across their five offices.
2. **Future Growth**: The company planned to open 10 new offices in the next two years.
3. **Departmental Structure**: Each office had distinct departments: Sales, Engineering, HR, and IT.
4. **Special Requirements**: The Engineering department needed larger subnets for their development environments.

Choosing the Address Range
--------------------------
After assessing their needs, Sarah decided to use private IP addresses from the Class A range: 10.0.0.0/8. "This will give us plenty of room to grow," she explained to her team.

Designing the Structure
-----------------------
Sarah sketched out a hierarchical structure on the whiteboard:

- The first octet (10) would remain constant.
- The second octet would represent the office location (0-254).
- The third octet would represent the department:
  - 1: Sales
  - 2: Engineering
  - 3: HR
  - 4: IT
- The fourth octet would be for individual hosts.

"This way," Sarah explained, "we can have up to 255 offices, each with up to 255 subnets, and each subnet can have up to 254 devices."

Implementing VLSM
-----------------
To address the Engineering department's need for larger subnets, Sarah implemented Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM):

- Sales, HR, IT: 10.office.dept.0/24 (254 hosts each)
- Engineering: 10.office.2.0/23 (510 hosts)

"By using VLSM," Sarah said, "we can allocate more IP addresses to Engineering without wasting addresses in smaller departments."

Naming Convention
-----------------
To improve clarity, Sarah established a naming convention: 
Location-Department-DeviceType-Number

For example: NYC-ENG-PRINTER-01 would be a printer in the New York City office's Engineering department.

Documentation and Growth Planning
---------------------------------
Sarah meticulously documented the new scheme, creating a spreadsheet that outlined:

- IP ranges for each office and department
- Subnet masks
- Reserved IP addresses for network devices
- Procedures for adding new subnets

"We'll reserve the IP ranges 10.250-254.0.0/16 for future expansion," Sarah told her team. "This gives us room to grow beyond our current plans if needed."

Implementation and Results
--------------------------
Over the next few months, Sarah and her team gradually implemented the new IP addressing scheme. They set up DHCP servers to automatically assign addresses within the defined ranges and updated firewall rules to reflect the new structure.

The results were transformative:

1. Network troubleshooting became much easier, as the IP address immediately indicated the device's location and department.
